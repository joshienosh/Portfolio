					<h2>Welcome!!! So here are a few things about me: </h2>
						
						<p>As a fresher, I want to put use of my creative skills, the technologies that I am familiar with and various innovative thoughts that will benefit an Organization in the long run and will also help me in building my professional career. I am very adaptive to working in different work environments, mixed with a realm of risk-it-all challenging tasks. I am also intrigued by creative designs and architectures that glorify the extent to which we humans can think. I am always optimistic and know how to diffuse a heavily pressured workload by time management and proactive learning. I like to work in a slightly less competetive environment, where there is an equal oppurtunity to establish and nurture talent as well as experience. </p>

					<h3>Energetic And Optimistic</h3>
					<p>I think one of my biggest traits is that I am always energetic and optmistic about any situtation put infront of me. I try to conceive my emotions while being highly logicall in solving problems. I have the unique ability to take a sinking ship and try to make it float, despite the obstacles in the ocean.</p>
					
					<br><br>
					<h3>The Voyager</h3>
					<p>I always like to travel and explore new places and different people. I am also intruiged by photography, and I am always up for a photoshoot. I feel that clicking a picture is enclosing the positiveness, the joy and the emotion attached with a place, that I tend to remember again by viewing my clicks.</p>

					<h3>Team Player</h3>
					<p>I typically avoid center of attention, but I have good experience in working within teams and potentially identfying key players of a team. I try to channelize the abilities of the individuals into one direction and solve problems collaboratively. </p>

					<h2>My Projects:</h2>
					<br><br><br>
					<h3>1. Fake Currency Detection.</h3>
					<p>The Fake Currency Detector is a comparatitive case study analysis on different fake currencies that are used in the world. I basically learned the basics of classification and regression analysis using statistical machine learning tools. I learned and implemented K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms to produce a score for whether image of a denomination is fake or not. I used openCV to alter and convert the test image into greyscale and used a threshold to remove the noise, followed by reducing the dimension of the image. I extracted the key features inside the image and exported the vector obtained to a KNN classifier to classify as "Fake" or "Real".</p>


					<h3>Big Data Analytics on Implant Training, IBM Hyderabad</h3>
					<p>During the tenure of this project, I investifated several normalization and approximation algorithms used in BDA. I learned about Random-forest algorithms and their implementation in context to healthcare data analytics. I implemented random-forest normalization on a small-scale dataset obtained from few hospitals to detect implant patterns in Implant training. I also learned R programming language to operate on the dataset,followed by Python, for visualizing the results obtained.</p>
